# Authorship Attribution with Machine Learning 📚🤖
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Authorship Attribution project, where machine learning meets linguistic analysis! This project is all about classifying authors of texts using their unique writing styles. The dataset comprises texts from six different authors, making it a supervised learning challenge with a twist of linguistics.

## Project Overview 🌟
Authorship Attribution is the process of identifying the author of a text based on their unique writing style or 'fingerprint'. This project is split into two main parts:

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering - Where we prepare the text data and extract meaningful features that capture the essence of each author's style.
2. Model Training and Evaluation - Where various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to find the one that best identifies the authors.
